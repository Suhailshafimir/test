    <h4>Rebel Point</h4>Kazi Nazrul Islam (Bengali: কাজী নজরুল ইসলাম, pronounced [kaːd͡ʒi nod͡ʒrul ɪslam] (listen);
    24 May 1899 & 29 August 1976) was a Bengali poet, writer, musician, and is the national poet of Bangladesh.[7]
    Nazrul is regarded as one of the greatest poets in Bengali literature. Popularly known as Nazrul, he produced a
    large body of poetry, music, messages, novels, stories, etc. with themes that included equality, justice,
    anti-imperialism, humanity, rebellion against oppression and religious devotion.[8] Nazrul's activism for
    political and social justice as well as writing a poem titled as "Bidrohī", meaning "the rebel" in Bengali,
    earned him the title of "Bidrohī Kôbi" (Rebel Poet).[9] His compositions form the avant-garde music genre of
    Nazrul Gīti (Music of Nazrul).

    <h4> Awesome Writer</h4>Nazrul wrote and composed music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded on HMV and
    gramophone records),[25] collectively known as Nazrul Gīti. In 1942 at the age of 43, he began to suffer from an
    unknown disease, losing his voice and memory. A medical team in Vienna diagnosed the disease as Pick's
    disease,[26] a rare incurable neurodegenerative disease. It caused Nazrul's health to decline steadily and
    forced him to live in isolation. He was also admitted in Ranchi (Jharkhand) psychiatric hospital for many years.
    At the invitation of the Government of Bangladesh, Nazrul's family took him to Bangladesh and moved to Dhaka in
    1972. He died four years later on 29 August 1976 It caused Nazrul's health to decline steadily and
