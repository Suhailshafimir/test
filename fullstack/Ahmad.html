  common in student life. Being a naughty boy,

             as in, "The passage to America was long and hard." A section of written work or
              music can also be called a passage. You can think of a passage of music as moving the
               listener from one part of the piece to <center><img src="istockphoto-1132817705-170667a.jpg"
                 width="800px height=400px"></center> the next. And, finally, you can call a path a
                passage or passageway, especially when it's narrow.
             A street is not a passage, but the little tunnel behind
              the secret door in your closet is certainly a passage.
